Welcome to our repository :)
This is my Undergraduate Research Project from the past one and a half years. It aims to perform a complete analysis of structures discretized into frame elements ‚Äî including equilibrium analysis and topology optimization.

### About Our Project

Using the Finite Element Method, we implemented Topology Optimization techniques for elements with six degrees of freedom per node. During the project, our initial goal was to minimize the compliance of the structure, subject to a volume constraint, using the SIMP approach. Yes, the classic problem. After validating the studied problems (both the mathematical approaches and the results obtained), our new objective became minimizing the structure's volume while imposing constraints on stress and displacement.
Currently, we're working on incorporating uncertainties in the applied loads ‚Äî specifically, their magnitude and angle.

### Key Points :sparkles:

- Modeling of frame elements
- Objective function: currently, minimizing the total volume of the structure
- Use of the Augmented Lagrangian Method, through the Adjoint Problem approach
- Utilization of visualization tools for mesh generation and results
- Easy implementation of examples for validation

### How it works 

  - We define the problem in a `.yaml` file
  - We perform the initial analysis using FEM
  - The optimization and sensitivity analysis process begins
  - We check for convergence
  - If the process is completed, a `.pos` file for visualization, compatible with the open-source software Gmsh, is generated.

## How to use
### Requirements:
- Julia Language -- make sure it's up to date
- Gmsh -- required for visualizing the results

### Installation:
1. First, clone the repository, on Julia:
    ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/CodeLenz/LFrame]
2. Navigate to the repository directory:
   ```bash
   cd("...\\LFrame")
3. Install the required Julia packages
   ```bash
   ]instantiate()
   ```

### Running an Example:
To run an exemple, simply use
```bash
  include("examples/example123.yaml")
```

This will perform an initial FEM analysis and start the optimization process. After the procedure is complete, a `.pos` file is generated for visualization in Gmsh. To view the results,
1. Open Gmsh
2. In the File menu, click Open
3. Navigate to the folder of the examples, the file will be generated there
4. Select the file

## Mathematical Formulation ‚öôÔ∏è

We started with the classic minimization of the structure's compliance with volume constraint, using the Optimum Criteria approach, and then, to optimize the optimization (üôÉ), we used the Augmented Lagrangian method.

With the sensitivity analysis being done with the derivatives of the Objective Function and the Augmented Lagrangian Function, the process is stopped when the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions are achieved. The validation of the codes was done in parts. The derivatives were compared to results using the Finite Differences method. The numerical results of the static analysis (i.e., the displacement vector found using the equilibrium equation) were compared to benchmark problems.
Two examples are shown in the next section.

Therefore, we were encouraged to continue with the research by adding new objectives and constraints. The new objective function is the volume of the structure, and displacements became the constraints. Therefore, we were ready to include the most problematic constraint, the local stress. An adjustment was made to the Augmented Lagrangian function to include the adjoint problem, improving the computational time of the process, a necessary step due to the larger number of constraints.

The current Optimization Problem is the minimization of the volume with local stress constraints.
